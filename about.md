            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Who Am I?</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">My name is Cole Johnson, and I am a 21-year-old undergraduate senior from the Washington, D.C., area. My biggest hobbies include playing sports (especially basketball, soccer, and tennis), reading science fiction, and recently learning Spanish and Mandarin. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Southern California and expect to graduate in May 2025.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align: center;">What Are My Interests?</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Since childhood, I have been fascinated by sci-fi books and movies about AI and its impact on the future. During the COVID pandemic, I used my extra free time to dive into this interest. I spent a year taking an online Stanford course on machine learning and launched my own projects, which eventually led to an internship where I developed a neural network to categorize the quality of gravitational wave data for LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory).</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">At USC, exploring the full range of topics within computer science has allowed me to broaden my interests beyond AI, including software, hardware, and more. My primary focus now is on applying my technical skills to real-world challengesâ€”whether by providing insights, building impactful applications, or conducting research in AI.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align: center;">What Are My Goals?</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">For most of my career, I plan to establish myself in the industry, working in fields like machine learning, software engineering, and data science. I aim to contribute to organizations leveraging computer science and mathematics to create meaningful global impact.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">After building a strong foundation of applied technical knowledge, I aspire to transition into higher-level roles that enable me to drive positive change. Ultimately, I hope to contribute to bettering the lives of as many people as possible through technology.</p>
